It can also create multiple tenant clusters with isolated pods which cannot accept connections from nodes of other tenants. While this works, storage resources would not be efficiently utilized and thus why ideal storage solution would need to abstract storage layer and provide logical isolations. This proposal addresses the ability of storage clusters to offer storage services to tenant isolated access pods.</p>
<p>This document explains a concept how Kubernetes (or the like orchestrations) could be provisioning NexentaEdge storage cluster and then independently provisioning multiple tenant access networks to access this same storage cluster.</p>
<p>Under this approach each tenant will have their own access network and their own storage namespace on a common backend storage cluster. The storage cluster will typically have a common backend storage network which serves all tenants. The storage cluster is in control of allocation of resources to different tenants. While it is not required to fully provision storage resources to each tenant it will typically enforce quota limitations on each tenant.</p>
<p>This proposal is intended to work with any storage cluster, but obviously we have very specific knowledge of NexentaEdge.</p>

<p>For the frontend tenant access networks the goal is to provide isolated pods that are all connected to the same tenant access network. Any underlying technology that prevents Tenant B clients from connecting to Tenant A pods can be selected. VLAN, VxLAN and firewall methods all work. What Kubernetes is lacking is a uniform strategy to allow multiple tenants to each have isolated networks to access a shared backend storage cluster.</p>
<p>A typical virtual tenant access network has Client Pods, supporting tenant-specific services such as AD or LDAP and pods providing the tenant access to storage services provided by the backend storage cluster.</p>
<p>This feature would enable a single backend storage cluster to provide storage services to multiple tenants from a single set of resources while maintaining strict tenant isolation. There would be zero or more tenant access networks which could be added/dropped as required and a backend storage network connecting backend storage Pods.</p>

<p>What is the objective of having multiple tenants access a single storage cluster?</p>
<p>Having separate tenants access a shared storage cluster over tenant-specific networks allows for either the network or the storage cluster to throttle overly greedy clients without having to enforce rigid division of bandwidth and IOPs capacities. Each tenant can burst their traffic at the full capacity of the cluster if no other tenant is competing for those resources.</p>
<p>Storage traffic, especially for active document archives, is very bursty. Sharing raw resources is very cost effective.</p>
<p>This is especially true for the type of storage cluster being discussed here, namely those providing persistence storage services using storage resources provided to. This is in contrast to metadata servers that access persistent storage via  a SAN that provides persistence. The type of  storage backend represented by NexentaEdge and others will gladly accept new resources when allocated, but manages fail-overs to existing resources on its own when storage servers, disk drives fail and/or a corrupt replica is protected.</p>
<p>While creating a storage cluster to provide service to a single tenant or a flat namespace. Providing a shared storage cluster enables economies of scale in providing persistent storage services. It no more has resources assigned to it for a specific tenant than a Bank has your cash pre-identified for you to withdraw. Serving multiple users from a single set of resources is efficient.</p>

<p>The economies of a shared storage cluster would be shunned if they can at the cost of exposing one tenants assets to any other tenant. Sharing costs is great, sharing data is not.</p>
<p>Presumably the backend storage cluster would also be capable of throttling requests in a tenant specific way so that no single tenant could monopolize the cluster resources without statically dividing physical resources into isolated pools incapable of lending idle resources to meet usage bursts.</p>
<p>All requests for the backend storage network Pods are tied to an authenticated tenant. So the backend pod can apportion its provisioned storage and network resources according to its own policies so that it can offer QoS guarantees to its Tenants.</p>
<p>Typically the Tenant Access networks would be best effort, but bandwidth guarantees can be provisioned on the L2 network and/or in firewall rules.</p>
<p>For each tenant the scope of available storage resources would be scoped by the Tenant ID. If access is through Tenant X's network then only Tenant X assets may be accessed. Tenant-specific ACLs may be additionally applied after that.</p>
<p>This layering of access control enables use of open-source software that has not been designed for multi-tenant access. Open-source file system daemons were largely designed when NAS was implemented over corporate intranets, not shared data center networks.</p>

<p>Merely publishing a Storage Service to a flat namespace creates issues for multi-tenant access.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a flat namespace, any advertisement of available mount points would be available to all clients.</li>
<li>The Storage Service would have to reject logins from user that were not part of the Tenant-specific network authorized to access the storage server.</li>
<li>Denial Of Service attacks would hit tenant-independent resources, threatening to bring done service to all tenants. With Tenant-specific networks the Storage Service would be able to confine the impact of a DoS attack to that specific network.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ganesha NFS daemon supports a pluggable File System Access Layer (FSAL) that makes it very convenient for providing NFS access over any storage service that resembles a file system, including object storage. Multi-tenant support with Ganesha requires creating Ganesha instances for each tenant. Similar implementation strategies are also employed with iSCSI targets.</p>

<p>This proposal also supports provisioning multiple different backend storage clusters, and even assigning generic &quot;storage server&quot; nodes to specific storage clusters. Tenants could then choose which storage backend their clients would be granted access to. While provisioning and configuring storage clusters typically varies between vendors it is very common for different storage clusters to support the same data plane APIs to access storage (NFS, CIFS, S3, Swift, iSCSI, etc.)</p>
<p>When a storage cluster requires a backend storage network it is typically relying on some form of custom congestion control other than TCP/IP. Examples include FCoE or RoCEE reliance no-drop Ethernet, FibreChannel or Infiniband. NexentaEdge use UDP but relies on traffic isolation provided by lossless Ethernet or some other equivalent L2 solution. Network isolation not only enables these strategies, it protect non-storage traffic from being drowned out by storage traffic.</p>
<p>Kubernetes network policy defaults to non-isolated pods. A Network Policy is required to impose access restrictions, and those restrictions may be enforced by accepting/rejecting TCP connections rather than by L2 traffic isolation.</p>
<p>The best L2 traffic engineering, based on the Datacenter Bridging 802.1 protocols, is only supported by switch specific policy's such as Big Switch Networks.</p>
<p>This proposal is compatible with scheduling multiple different storage backends in the same cluster, however the backend network resources are allocated.</p>
<p>While this allows &quot;dynamically&quot; allocating a storage cluster it must be remembered that each new storage cluster would formatting the local storage volumes allocated to it. There is no cluster-independent definition of persistent storage. This is not a solution for dynamically creating storage clusters on demand, but rather for allowing long-term reallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Many storage clusters have similar demands for a &quot;Storage server&quot;, and ability to periodically rebalance the allocation of storage servers between different storage clusters is certainly desirable. Even if storage clusters are completely static, the convenience of using Kubernetes to provision them and to keep Container code images up to date would be valuable.</p>

<p>The backend storage cluster must be provisioned before any tenant access networks are added or removed. The backend storage network frequently has specialized requirements, and specific characteristics may be desired for local storage. Kubernetes has sufficient options to customize host selection to enable provisioning of even very picky storage clusters.</p>
<p>After this backend network is provisioned we need to tag the selected hosts so that Tenant Access Pods can be provisioned to hosts that already have the backend storage service Pod running. Ideally, only nodes requiring optimized access to the backend storage network should be scheduled directly on these gateway hosts.</p>
<p>An example of an end result is depicted below, with two different Tenant Access Pods communicating with a single Backend Storage Service Pod.</p>
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
A(Tenant A Access Pod)-->FrontNIC(Frontend NIC);
A-->LocalHostIPC(Localhost IPC);
B(Tenant B Access Pod)-->FrontNIC;
B-->LocalHostIPC;
S(Backend Storage Service Pod)-->FrontNIC;
S-->LocalHostIPC;
S-->BackendNIC(Backend NIC);
</div>
<p>There would be a minimum of one Pod for each tenant, although tenants could have multiple Pods to accommodate varying scheduling requirements. Separation of services into different addresses spaces is frequently desirable, but it is not a requirement for providing multi-tenant service. What is required is that each tenant Pod has tenant-quarantined access to the FrontEnd NIC.</p>
<p>A BackendStorageServicePod (or pods) has previously been provisioned with access to the BackendNIC. For many storage clusters this will be a network with specific quality of service guarantees and specialized resource allocation needs. Some may require lossless Ethernet service, Fibre Channel, Infiniband or merely some guaranteed bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Tenant Access Pods communicate with the Backend Storage Service POD via localhost IPC. This may be used for all communication, or merely to set up shared memory message queuing.</p>
<p>The Backend Storage Service Pod could authenticate each Tenant Access Pod, but would find life simpler if the scheduling policy simply enforced that Tenant access Pods would be scheduled on this host. The Pod could certainly have hyper-converged Containers.</p>
<p>When a new Tenant Pod was added it would use the LocalHostIPC to register itself with the Backend Storage Service Pod, and establish itself as being associated with a specific Tenant.</p>
<p>If the performance demands for a given Tenant Access Pod were high enough the Access Pod and Backend Pod would use initial IPC messages to set up a higher performance channel such as a message queue through shared memory. Shared memory should be allocated by and owned by the Tenant Access pod since it should be deallocated when the Tenant Access Pod is deactivated.</p>
<p>When a Tenant C is added those pods would register with the Backend Storage Service Pod. It would the mix the interfaces with the Tenant C Pods to the list of interfaces it was polling. Load-balancing and prioritizing among Tenants A, B and C would be left to the discretion of the backend pod.</p>
<p>What is important is that the backend pod be able to determine which Tenant is behind each request, and that only approved Tenant Access Pods can try to access it.</p>

<p>The steps required for dynamic multiple tenant support are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule the Storage Cluster on N machines. Mark those that are eligible to act as gateway/proxy machines as being access hosts for this specific Storage Service.</li>
<li>To add a Tenant Access Network:
<ul>
<li>Schedule Tenant Access Pods on hosts marked as providing Storage Service X.</li>
<li>Configure these Pods to access a Virtual Access Network which includes external clients and required Tenant-specific support services (such as AD/LDAP).</li>
<li>When launched the Tenant Access Pod will register with the Backend Storage Service Pod authenticating itself as working for the specific tenant.</li>
<li>The Backend Storage Service Pod will now prpvide service via IPC, or a communication path setup using IPC, to access Tenant-specific storage services. For example, each Tenant accessing NFS services would only have access to mount points defined by the tenant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To drop a Tenant Access service:
<ul>
<li>Logoff the Backend Storage Service Pod using the IPC channel.</li>
<li>Shutdown the Tenant Access Pod.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When there are no Tenant Access Pods a Backend Storage Service <em>may</em> be terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Membership in either the Tenant Access Networks or the Backend Storage Network may be changed at any time using normal Kubernetes procedures. This does not change the relationships between the networks.</p>
