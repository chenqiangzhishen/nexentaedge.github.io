## Overview

NexentaEdge is fast, feature rich and easy to use File, Block and Object storage for your Cloud-Native Applications. It is designed to make it easy to integrate an enterprise class storage system with existing "shared-nothing" style storage, networking and compute services.

NexentaEdge deployed as Kubernetes PODs on physical or virtual hosts, pooling allocated storage capacity and presenting it for consumption by applications. NexentaEdge designed with High-Performance and Data Reduction in mind. It provides best in class throughput and latency characteristics while saving overall allocated space with built-in in-line global De-Duplication, Compression and off-line Erasure Encoding.

Once deployed, PV storage can be claimed either via standard S3FS, iSCSI or NFS providers or via CSI (currently available only for Kubernetes >= 1.10). Additionally Cluster name spaces and tenants can be managed via YAML pre-installed CLI and GUI. This further orchestrates Kubernetes service creation.
